### Description

This bot provides a text bridge between an IRC channel and a Mumble server.

### How to install/configure/run

You can directly run sftbot by typing `./run` or `python2 -m sftbot`.
To permanently install sftbot, type `sudo ./setup.py install`. Then, you can run it by typing `sftbot`.

You need to provide a config file that (among others) contains user credentials for the bot. An example conf file can be found in `sftbot.conf.example`.

You can either specify a conf file path as a command line argument (`sftbot myconffile.conf`), or place it at `./sftbot.conf` or `/etc/sftbot.conf`.

#### Generating Self-Signed Certificates ####

This bot has the capabilities of using Mumble's built-in SSL authentication methods to authenticate and register your bot on the server. If certificates are not generated, the bot will still be able to join the server, but it cannot be registered as an authenticated user on the server. To use this feature, you can generate a self-signed SSL certificate for the bot by running the following line in the root of the sftmumblebot installation directory:
`$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`

If you permanently install the script, you should specificy an absolute path in front of the certicates on the `sftbot.config` file.

### Behaviour

By default, the bot

- Relays messages from a mumble channel to an IRC channel
- Leaves the channel when somebody types 'gtfo'
- Tries to reconnect on connection failures

However, this behaviour can be altered easily by editing `sftbot/__main__.py`, which contains several fairly self-explainatory callback functions that will be automatically invoked at the appropriate times.
For example, certain IRC messages may be ignored by adding a line `if message.contains('bannedtext'): return` to the top of `ircTextMessageCallback`.
More complex, 'botty' behaviour may be implemented the same way; note that you can call `irc.sendTextMessage()` and `mumble.sendTextMessage()` from everywhere within the callback functions.

### Dependencies

- python2
- protobuf-python (Debian/Ubuntu package: python-protobuf, Arch package: python2-protobuf)

### TODOs

Nice-to-have features (which we don't plan to implement right now, but feel free to do it yourself):

- ~~SSL certificate validation support~~
- ~~SSL client certificate support~~
- More chat protocols (e.g. XMPP multi-user chat)
- Init scripts for `<your distribution here>`

### Misc

Mumble uses Google Protobuf for most of its communications; this means that one code file needs to be auto-generated (that's what the `Makefile` is there for). Unfortunately, `protoc` does not officially support `python3`, so we're forced to deal with `python2` and all its string buffer ugliness.

### Contact

You can find us at `irc.freenode.net/#sfttech`. If you found a bug, feel free to join and randomly insult channel OPs until someone fixes it (or bans you).
Alternatively, fix it yourself and send a pull request.
